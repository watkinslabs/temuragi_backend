# Temuragi
The Intelligent Meta-Definition Framework

## Our Vision
Temuragi transforms how organizations build, manage and deploy reports through our revolutionary meta-definition approach. We empower users to define once, deploy everywhere.

## The Temuragi Difference

Temuragi (tem·u·ra·gi) embodies:

- Temu - Representing structure and technical precision
- ragi (羅義) - Symbolizing "framework of logic" or "order/principle net"
Together, these elements form our core philosophy: Structured logic through elegant templating

## Core Benefits
- Meta-Define Once - Create structured definitions that generate consistent reports across all platforms
- Dynamic Rendering - Automatically adapt to any display context or data source
- Rapid Deployment - Slash report development time by 80%
- Version Control - Track changes and maintain governance at the definition level
- Extensible Foundation - Build your own components or leverage our growing library

## Who We Serve
Organizations tired of rebuilding the same reports for different platforms, teams seeking enterprise-wide reporting consistency, and developers who value elegant, maintainable solutions.
